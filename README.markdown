# Morse.js
## A jQuery Plugin that annotates text with Morse Code

Samuel F. B. Morse created a code for the electric telegraph in the early 1840s that allowed alphanumeric characters to be encoded into a sequence of short and long tones. It is still widely used among radio operators as a means of identifying themselves, as well as communicating messages over a channel too narrow or noisy for speech transmission.[<sup>1</sup>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

This plugin will transcribe the morse code for text in the selected elements. In browsers that support the [`<ruby>` HTML element](http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-ruby-19981221/), the transcription will appear above the text. By default, clicking on these elements will play the corresponding audio for the transcription.

## Usage

``` javascript
$("p").morseCode({bpm:12});
```

- `bpm` rate at which the message is played (default: 12, or 1 unit = 100ms)

In addition, there are two namespaced events that you can `trigger` and `bind` to:

- `morse.emit` will generate and play the tones for morse code elements
- `morse.mute` will stop morse code tone sounds from `<audio>` elements

## Requirements

- jQuery 1.4+
